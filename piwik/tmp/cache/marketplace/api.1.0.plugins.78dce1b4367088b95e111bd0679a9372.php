TreemapVisualization is a Piwik plugin that provides the treemap report visualization.

## Features

The treemap visualization will show rows of data tables as squares whose size correspond to the metric of the row. For example, if you\'re looking at visits, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like the other graph visualizations, you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that it shows much more rows.

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the evolution of each row. You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

## Limitations

Currently there is one known limitation:

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the evolution of each row. You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

### Limitations

Currently there is one known limitation:

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.

TreemapVisualization contains a new report visualization that will display your reports as tiles of different sizes and will show you how each metric has changed from the last period.

The treemap visualization displays rows of data as squares whose size corresponds to a metric in each row.

If you\'re looking at the visits in a report, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like other graph visualizations, **you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values**. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that **it can show many more rows**.

#### Treemap colors for comparison with previous period

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the **evolution** of each row. Hovering over a treemap square will show you how much the row changed from the last period (ie, the last day, week, etc.).

Each treemap square is colored based on the evolution value **so you can easily see how your data is changing**. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

#### Known limitations

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.
* Evolution values cannot be calculated for subtables (reports that are displayed when you click on a row or node).

## Description

This is a plugin for Piwik that generates reports about the IPv6 reach of your websites. It is written as a tracker plugin and directly hooks into the Piwik tracking call.

## Documentation

I wrote an article about the development that lead to this plugin and explained how the plugin works internally. You can find the article at [Geekmonkey](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/34-how-to-write-a-piwik-plugin)

There is also a [short article](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/33-tracking-the-ipv6-reach-of-your-website-with-piwik/) that explains how to setup the plugin.

* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-websites --limit 100` generates 100 websites
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5`  generates many visits for site with id 5 for today

## Description

Piwik login that uses LDAP queries to authenticate users.

HowTo Create a new User from LDAP in Piwik:
1) Login to Piwik backend as superuser
2) Navigate to Settings->LDAP Users
3) If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

Note:
Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

Note2:
Users may be modified and deleted via Settings->Users

Note3:
If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

Note4:
When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Settings->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

**Piwik login that uses LDAP queries to authenticate users and offeres Kerberos SSO support.**

#### HowTo Create a new User from LDAP in Piwik:
* Login to Piwik backend as superuser
* Navigate to Manage->LDAP Users
* If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

#### Note:
* Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

#### Note2:
* Users may be modified and deleted via Manage->Users

#### Note3:
* If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

#### Note4:
* When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Manage->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

**Piwik login that uses LDAP queries to authenticate users and offeres Kerberos SSO support.**

#### HowTo Create a new User from LDAP in Piwik:
* Login to Piwik backend as superuser
* Navigate to Manage->LDAP Users
* If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

#### Note:
* Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

#### Note2:
* Users may be modified and deleted via Manage->Users

#### Note3:
* If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

#### Note4:
* When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Manage->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day? Create alerts that make sense to you. Be notified by email or SMS when the conditions for your alerts are met. Stay on top of your website!

The Alert log will help you to better understand the success of your website. You can use it to analyze how often your website hit more than 10000 visits per day or on how many days a product was sold more than 50 times.

This plugin was [crowdfunded with the support](http://crowdfunding.piwik.org/custom-alerts-plugin/) of 37 Piwik community members!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-CustomAlerts.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-CustomAlerts)

## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day? Create alerts that make sense to you. Be notified by email or SMS when the conditions for your alerts are met. Stay on top of your website!

The Alert log will help you to better understand the success of your website. You can use it to analyze how often your website hit more than 10000 visits per day or on how many days a product was sold more than 50 times.

This plugin was [crowdfunded with the support](http://crowdfunding.piwik.org/custom-alerts-plugin/) of 37 Piwik community members!

BotTracker-Plugin for Piwik

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, some things you should be aware of:

- many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.

- if you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

- the "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.


And last but not least:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I fell like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin beacute I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawler, that hit yout page.

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.



Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

If you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed.

The "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.

It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will <em>not</em> activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.</p>

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawler, that hit yout page.

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.



Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

If you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```


The "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.


## Changelog
__0.45__
* add column to primary key in extra-stats-table

__0.44__
